# Night Owlish 🌙🦉

## 🚧 WIP 🚧

A tmTheme adaptation† of [@sdras](https://github.com/sdras/)' [Night Owl VS Code theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)…

* Theme for [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) editor generated using `.tmtheme` import instructions found [here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Importing-.tmtheme-and-.tmlanguage-Files-into-Ace) (plus some manual modifications to [`.css`](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/aceTheme/night_owl.css) file).  

* Theme for [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE generated using the theme importer in [RStudio daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com/), with modifications to [`.rstheme`](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/rstheme/night-owlish.rstheme) file.

† _Full disclosure: I don't actually use TextMate — this was but a means to an end, as RStudio (which uses Ace) allows you to import tmThemes. If it looks terrible, and you have fixes please submit a PR! 🙏_
